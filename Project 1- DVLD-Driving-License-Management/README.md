## Driving License Management System

Developed a comprehensive desktop application for managing driving licenses, leveraging C# and .NET within a 3-tier architecture. This system streamlines processes for issuing, renewing, and scheduling tests for driving licenses, integrating SQL Server for efficient data management. The project strengthened my expertise in object-oriented programming, modular application design, and scalable database integration, ensuring a robust, maintainable solution tailored for real-world administrative needs.
